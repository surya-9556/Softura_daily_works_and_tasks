                        The Lamborghini Gallardo has been the Italian automaker’s most successful car to date with a total
                        production of 14,002 units in its 10-year life span. When it announced that the Gallardo was being retired,
                        many said that the successor had big shoes to fill and would probably have to just as crazy
                        as the Gallardo was when it was launched.
